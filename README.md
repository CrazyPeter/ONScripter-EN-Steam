# ONScripter-EN-Steam
A version of ONScripter-EN designed to work with the Steam API

# Compiling on Windows
1. Install MinGW and MSYS
2. Run "make"

This will create "onscripter-en.exe"

(DO NOT run ./configure, this will overwrite the makefile and compiling will not work)

Please also make sure to place the Steam files in the /include and /lib folders before compiling.
